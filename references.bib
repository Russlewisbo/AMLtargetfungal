A 100\% absorbable oral formulation of the hypomethylating agent decitabine was approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, and might be used as an alternative to parenteral hypomethylating agents. Several of the approvals are as single-agent therapies or in specific combinations for narrow indications, thus offering poor treatment value. In this Review, we discuss ongoing research into combinations containing these commercially available targeted therapies for acute myeloid leukaemia.},

  abstract = {Progress is occurring at a dizzying rate across all leukemias. Since the authors' review of the topic in Cancer in 2018, numerous discoveries have been made that have improved the therapy and outcomes of several leukemia subsets. Hairy cell leukemia is potentially curable with a single course of cladribine followed by rituximab (10-year survival, {$\geq$}90\%). Acute promyelocytic leukemia is curable at a rate of 80\% to 90\% with a nonchemotherapy regimen of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide. The cure rate for core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is {$\geq$}75\% with fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Survival for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia is close to that for an age-matched normal population with BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a previously incurable disease, may now be potentially curable with a finite duration of therapy with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors and venetoclax. The estimated 5-year survival rate for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) exceeds 70\% with intensive chemotherapy and ponatinib, a third-generation BCR-ABL1 TKI, and more recent nonchemotherapy regimens using dasatinib or ponatinib with blinatumomab are producing outstanding results. Survival in both younger and older patients with ALL has improved with the addition of antibodies targeting CD20, CD19 (blinatumomab), and CD22 (inotuzumab) to chemotherapy. Several recent drug discoveries (venetoclax, FLT3 and IDH inhibitors, and oral hypomethylating agents) are also improving outcomes for younger and older patients with AML and for those with higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome.},

  abstract = {On the basis of improved overall survival, treatment guidelines strongly recommend antifungal prophylaxis during remission induction chemotherapy for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Many novel targeted agents are metabolised by cytochrome P450, but potential drug\textendash drug interactions (DDIs) and the resulting risk\textendash benefit ratio have not been assessed in clinical trials, leading to uncertainty in clinical management. Consequently, the European Haematology Association commissioned experts in the field of infectious diseases, haematology, oncology, clinical pharmacology, and methodology to develop up-to-date recommendations on the role of antifungal prophylaxis and management of pharmacokinetic DDIs with triazole antifungals. A systematic literature review was performed according to Cochrane methods, and recommendations were developed by use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Evidence to Decision framework. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library, including Central Register of Controlled Trials, for randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews published from inception to March 10, 2020. We excluded studies that were not published in English. Evidence for any identified novel agent that is active against acute myeloid leukaemia was reviewed for the following outcomes: incidence of invasive fungal disease, prolongation of hospitalisation, days spent in intensive-care unit, mortality due to invasive fungal disease, quality of life, and potential DDIs. Recommendations and consensus statements were compiled for each targeted drug for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and each specific setting. Evidence-based recommendations were developed for hypomethylating agents, midostaurin, and the venetoclax\textendash hypomethylating agent combination. For all other agents, consensus statements were given for specific therapeutic settings, specifically for the management of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia, monotherapy, and combination with chemotherapy. Antifungal prophylaxis is recommended with moderate strength in most settings, and strongly recommended if the novel acute myeloid leukaemia agent is administered in combination with intensive induction chemotherapy. For ivosidenib, lestaurtinib, quizartinib, and venetoclax, we moderately recommend adjusting the dose of the antileukaemic agent during administration of triazoles. This is the first guidance supporting clinical decision making on antifungal prophylaxis in recipients of novel targeted drugs for acute myeloid leukaemia. Future studies including therapeutic drug monitoring will need to determine the role of dosage adjustment of novel antileukaemic drugs during concomitant administration of CYP3A4-inhibiting antifungals with respect to adverse effects and remission status.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Venetoclax, a targeted anticancer agent approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzyme (CYP3A4). Posaconazole, commonly used to prevent invasive fungal infections in neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies, potently inhibits CYP3A4. The purpose of this evaluation was to predict venetoclax exposures following co-administration of posaconazole at doses not previously studied clinically. METHODS: Two physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were developed for posaconazole based on published parameters, one for an oral suspension and another for delayed released tablets. Parameter optimization, guided by sensitivity analyses, was conducted such that the models could replicate clinical exposures of posaconazole and drug-drug interactions with sensitive CYP3A substrates including venetoclax. The clinically verified posaconazole PBPK models were then utilized to predict DDI with a previously published venetoclax PBPK model at clinically relevant dosing scenarios. RESULTS: The posaconazole PBPK models predicted posaconazole exposure and DDI related fold changes with acceptable prediction errors for both posaconazole formulations. The model predicted exposures of venetoclax, when co-administered with a 300~mg QD dose of delayed release tablets of posaconazole, were in concordance with observed data. Increasing the posaconazole dose to 500~mg QD increased venetoclax exposures by about 12\% relative to 300~mg QD, which were still within the venetoclax safe exposure range. CONCLUSIONS: The posaconazole PBPK models were developed and clinically verified. Predictions using the robust PBPK model confirmed the venetoclax label recommendation of 70~mg in the presence of posaconazole at doses up to 500~mg QD.},

  abstract = {Several small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) have been recently approved for AML patients. These targeted therapies could be more tolerable than classical antineoplastics, but potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) are relatively frequent. Underestimation or lack of appropriate awareness and management of DDIs with SMIs can jeopardize therapeutic success in AML patients, which often require multiple concomitant medications in the context of prior comorbidities or for the prevention and treatment of infectious and other complications. In this systematic review, we analyze DDIs of glasdegib, venetoclax, midostaurin, quizartinib, gilteritinib, enasidenib, and ivosidenib. CYP3A4 is the main enzyme responsible for SMIs metabolism, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such azoles, could increase drug exposure and toxicity; therefore dose adjustments (venetoclax, quizartinib, and ivosidenib) or alternative therapies or close monitoring (glasdegib, midostaurin, and gilteritinib) are recommended. Besides, coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with SMIs should be avoided due to potential decrease of efficacy. Regarding tolerability, QTc prolongation is frequently observed for most of approved SMIs, and drugs with a potential to prolong the QTc interval and CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided and replaced by alternative treatments. In this study, we critically assess the DDIs of SMIs, and we summarize best management options for these new drugs and concomitant medications.},

The impact of a pre-emptive, diagnostic-driven approach based on galactomannan (GM) screening and chest CT-scan on demand on survival and on the risk of invasive fungal disease (IFD) during the first weeks of high-risk neutropenia is unknown.Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients were randomly assigned to receive caspofungin empirically (Arm A) or pre-emptively (Arm B). All patients received fluconazole 400\hspace{0.25em}mg daily as prophylaxis. The primary endpoint of this non-inferiority study was overall survival (OS) 42 days after randomization.Of 556 patients recruited, 549 were eligible: 275 in Arm A, 274 in Arm B. Eighty percent of the patients had AML or MDS requiring high-dose chemotherapy and 93\% of them were in first induction phase. At day 42, the OS was not inferior in Arm B (96.7\%; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 93.8 - 98.3\%) when compared to Arm A (93.1\%; 95\% CI, 89.3 - 95.5\%). The rates of IFDs at day 84 were not significantly different, 7.7\% (95\%CI, 4.5\textendash 10.8\%) in Arm B versus 6.6\% (95\%CI, 3.6\textendash 9.5\%) in Arm A, respectively. The rate of patients receiving caspofungin was significantly lower in Arm B (27\%) than in Arm A (63\%) (p\,\&lt;\,0.001).The pre-emptive antifungal strategy was safe for high-risk neutropenic patients given fluconazole as prophylaxis, halving the number of patients receiving antifungals without excess mortality or IFDs.}

  abstract = {Progress is occurring at a dizzying rate across all leukemias. Since the authors' review of the topic in Cancer in 2018, numerous discoveries have been made that have improved the therapy and outcomes of several leukemia subsets. Hairy cell leukemia is potentially curable with a single course of cladribine followed by rituximab (10-year survival, {$\geq$}90\%). Acute promyelocytic leukemia is curable at a rate of 80\% to 90\% with a nonchemotherapy regimen of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide. The cure rate for core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is {$\geq$}75\% with fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Survival for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia is close to that for an age-matched normal population with BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a previously incurable disease, may now be potentially curable with a finite duration of therapy with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors and venetoclax. The estimated 5-year survival rate for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) exceeds 70\% with intensive chemotherapy and ponatinib, a third-generation BCR-ABL1 TKI, and more recent nonchemotherapy regimens using dasatinib or ponatinib with blinatumomab are producing outstanding results. Survival in both younger and older patients with ALL has improved with the addition of antibodies targeting CD20, CD19 (blinatumomab), and CD22 (inotuzumab) to chemotherapy. Several recent drug discoveries (venetoclax, FLT3 and IDH inhibitors, and oral hypomethylating agents) are also improving outcomes for younger and older patients with AML and for those with higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome.},

  abstract = {A retrospective analysis of 48 patients with documented or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA) prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was conducted in 16 centers. Treatment of primary IA was medical in all 48 patients and surgical in 20; clinicoradiological resolution of IA occurred in 30 of 48 patients. Pretransplantation risk factors for relapse IA, total mortality, and IA-related mortality were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression with the following dichotomous risk factors: surgery as part of the initial treatment, resolution of IA by the time of BMT, donor type, conditioning regiment, total-body irradiation, T cell depletion, immunosuppressive therapy, type of antifungal prophylaxis, and growth factor prophylaxis. Conditioning with busulfan/cyclophosphamide was associated with a beneficial outcome for total survival and reduced IA-related mortality. Posttransplantation risk factors such as the development of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), therapy for GVHD, and the duration of neutropenia did not have a significant effect on relapse IA, IA-related mortality, or total mortality. The overall incidence of relapse IA was lower than expected (33\% [16 of 48 patients]), but the mortality rate among relapsed patients was 88\% (14 of 16). Patients receiving prophylaxis with absorbable or intravenous antifungals had less relapses of IA than did those not receiving prophylaxis (12 of 41 vs. four of seven, respectively). This finding reflects the need for better prophylaxis and new antifungal treatments for patients undergoing BMT who have a history of IA.},

  abstract = {Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) represent an important cause of treatment failure in adults with acute leukemia. Because of leukemia's heterogeneity, the risk for IFDs is highly variable. We therefore apply a risk-adapted antifungal strategy with strong emphasis on pretreatment and day-15 posttreatment to allow earlier and more individualized interventions. We determine pretreatment risks for IFDs based on 4 factors: (1) host fitness for standard therapy (ie, fit, unfit, or frail); (2) leukemia resistance (high vs low probability of achieving complete remission [CR]); (3) anticipated treatment-related toxicity such as neutropenia, mucositis, and steroid-induced immunosuppression; and (4) patient exposure to opportunistic fungi. Accordingly, we stratify patients as high, intermediate, or low risk for IFDs and apply risk-adapted antifungal strategies, including primary or secondary prophylaxis and diagnostic-based preemptive or empiric therapy. Prevention of IFDs also relies on optimizing organ function, decreasing exposure to opportunistic fungi, and improving net state of immunosuppression with use of better-tolerated and investigational agents for unfit patients and those with adverse leukemia biology. Novel targeted and safe therapies that can achieve higher rates of sustained CR among patients with adverse genetics offer the best promise for reducing the burden of IFDs in these patients.},

  abstract = {On the basis of improved overall survival, treatment guidelines strongly recommend antifungal prophylaxis during remission induction chemotherapy for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Many novel targeted agents are metabolised by cytochrome P450, but potential drug\textendash drug interactions (DDIs) and the resulting risk\textendash benefit ratio have not been assessed in clinical trials, leading to uncertainty in clinical management. Consequently, the European Haematology Association commissioned experts in the field of infectious diseases, haematology, oncology, clinical pharmacology, and methodology to develop up-to-date recommendations on the role of antifungal prophylaxis and management of pharmacokinetic DDIs with triazole antifungals. A systematic literature review was performed according to Cochrane methods, and recommendations were developed by use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Evidence to Decision framework. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library, including Central Register of Controlled Trials, for randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews published from inception to March 10, 2020. We excluded studies that were not published in English. Evidence for any identified novel agent that is active against acute myeloid leukaemia was reviewed for the following outcomes: incidence of invasive fungal disease, prolongation of hospitalisation, days spent in intensive-care unit, mortality due to invasive fungal disease, quality of life, and potential DDIs. Recommendations and consensus statements were compiled for each targeted drug for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and each specific setting. Evidence-based recommendations were developed for hypomethylating agents, midostaurin, and the venetoclax\textendash hypomethylating agent combination. For all other agents, consensus statements were given for specific therapeutic settings, specifically for the management of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia, monotherapy, and combination with chemotherapy. Antifungal prophylaxis is recommended with moderate strength in most settings, and strongly recommended if the novel acute myeloid leukaemia agent is administered in combination with intensive induction chemotherapy. For ivosidenib, lestaurtinib, quizartinib, and venetoclax, we moderately recommend adjusting the dose of the antileukaemic agent during administration of triazoles. This is the first guidance supporting clinical decision making on antifungal prophylaxis in recipients of novel targeted drugs for acute myeloid leukaemia. Future studies including therapeutic drug monitoring will need to determine the role of dosage adjustment of novel antileukaemic drugs during concomitant administration of CYP3A4-inhibiting antifungals with respect to adverse effects and remission status.},

Treatment with VEN-HMAs results in prolonged cytopenia, thereby exposing patients to invasive fungal infections (IFIs). Here, we retrospectively studied a cohort of 119 AML patients treated with VEN-HMAs and analyzed the occurrence of IFIs, as well as our practice of antifungal prophylaxis, with the aim to identify the nature and risk factors for IFIs and their association with the type of antifungal prophylaxis used. The intended antifungal prophylaxis was micafungin in 38\% of patients, azoles in 41\% of patients, and none in 21\% of patients. Older age was associated with no antifungal prophylaxis or micafungin use and lesser use of azoles (P = .043). We recorded 15 (12.6\%) patients who developed probable or proven IFIs, with a median onset of 72 days (range, 35-281) after starting therapy. IFIs were more common among nonresponders compared with responders to VEN-HMA therapy (22\% vs 6\%, P = .0132) and in r/r compared with newly diagnosed AML (19\% vs 5\%, P = .0498); however, the antifungal prophylaxis used, patient age, hypomethylating agent schedule, history of prior allogeneic transplant, and initial neutropenia duration did not influence the development of IFIs during therapy. We conclude that the overall risk of IFIs during VEN-HMA therapy is low. The risk of IFIs is higher in nonresponders and in those who were treated in the r/r setting; these patients need reevaluation of their antifungal prophylaxis to minimize the risk of IFIs during therapy.},
